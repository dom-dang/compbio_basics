# Basic Computational Biology Toolkit

Author: Dominique Dang (ddang@mit.edu), Michaela Bartusel 
  
## Purpose
For this UROP, I will be conducting research under Dr. Michaela Bartusel in Professor Eliezer Calo's Lab. This project aims to establish a workflow for Nanopore sequencing of tRNA. Findings from this project would provide a new tool for studying tRNA processing in health and disease and have broad implications in the bioinformatics field as well as clinical research on genetic disorders involving tRNA splicing defects.
